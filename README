VoyagerConnect will be an Android service. 

It will run fully autonomously without the need for user intervention. 

Its purpose is to provide a link between the OBD vehicle and the user interface. 

The User Interface will connect via one or both of the following TCP links: "Command" and "Event". 

VoyagerConnect can be configured to be launched on certain events
	- car docked
	- User Interface started on local phone


V.C. will also do its best to detect vehicle state - running, stopped, and talley up trip statistics.
